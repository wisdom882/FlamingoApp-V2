                <h2>TIKI TAKA</h2>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    This football tactic is usually played with a 4-3-3 formation,
                    where the goalkeeper acts as a sweeper keeper, the defenders must
                    be good and comfortable on the ball and Midfielders require fluidity
                    in passing and movement.
                    Teams that usually use this formation such as Barcelona under Pep Guardiola
                    in 2009 usually have 60-70% of the ball, which tires out the opponent because they
                    keep chasing the ball and the other ream just waits for the right time to take advantage
                    of them.
                </p>

                </div>


                <h2>COUNTER ATTACK</h2>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    A formation like the 4-2-3-1 can use used to carry out the tactical masterclass
                    it requires defenders to be tight and compact, deep lying midfielders to be ready
                    to spring for attack, and wingers to exploit space.
                    Patience is the word  to perfectly describe this tactic because as opposed to the
                    tiki taka tactic this time you let the opposing team the maority of the ball while
                    the other team waits patiently till a mistake occurs and they can capitlize on that
                    very quickly.
                    Real Madrid under Carlo Ancelotti in 2014 was a prime exmaple.

                <h2>PARK THE BUS</h2>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    Defender who will be able to tuck in, winger that acts as full backs and a sole
                    striker upfront is what you'll need when carrying out this tactic.
                    This style of play is usually tagged as a negative tactic and is known to be used by
                    the famous Jose Mourhino, is said to be like this because everyone in the team is behind
                    the ball and not really trying to win the ball back, instead defending very deep and often
                    try to counter when the regain posseion.
                    This tactic can be used in various occasion like playing out a for a draw when the game is over
                    or defending a slender lead like a 1-0 within less than 10 minitues to go.
                    Chelsea under Jose Mourhinho in 2013 was a prime example.

                <h2>LONG BALL</h2>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    This is a very old style of play where the defenders and Midfielders
                    have to be good on the ball and have good long range of passing, wingers
                    that work tirelessly while the striker has to be strong in the air and 
                    have a good touch to control the incoming long ball.
                    Usually teams who use this tactics often sit back and let the opposing team
                    have the ball and when they lose it they start the attack with a long ball over
                    the top for the lone striker.
                    Bolton under Sam Allardyce in 2004 often played like this.

                <h2>HIGH PRESS</h2>
                <p className="paragraph">
                   This tactis requires huge amounts of energy so the forward players
                   must be prepared to be running endlessly, midfielders must be prepared
                   to win the ball in the opposing half, and defenders have to play a highline
                   to choke the midfield and not aloow the opposing team time on the ball.
                   This is a very positive style of play because  the team is pressing the opposing
                   team for the ball and not giving them time on it which leads to mistakes and they
                   can easily capitlizeon that.
                   Borussia Dortmund under Jorgen Klopp in 2012 was a prime example.
