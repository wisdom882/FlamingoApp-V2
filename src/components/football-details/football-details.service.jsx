      title: "TIKI TAKA",
      description: `This football tactic is usually played with a 4-3-3 formation,
        where the goalkeeper acts as a sweeper keeper, the defenders must
        be good and comfortable on the ball and Midfielders require fluidity
        in passing and movement.
        Teams that usually use this formation such as Barcelona under Pep Guardiola
        in 2009 usually have 60-70% of the ball, which tires out the opponent because they
        keep chasing the ball and the other ream just waits for the right time to take advantage
        of them.`,

      title: "COUNTER ATTACK",
      description: `A formation like the 4-2-3-1 can use used to carry out the tactical masterclass
        it requires defenders to be tight and compact, deep lying midfielders to be ready
        to spring for attack, and wingers to exploit space.
        Patience is the word  to perfectly describe this tactic because as opposed to the
        tiki taka tactic this time you let the opposing team the maority of the ball while
        the other team waits patiently till a mistake occurs and they can capitlize on that
        very quickly.
        Real Madrid under Carlo Ancelotti in 2014 was a prime exmaple.`,

    {
      title: "LONG BALL",
      description: ` This is a very old style of play where the defenders and Midfielders
        have to be good on the ball and have good long range of passing, wingers
        that work tirelessly while the striker has to be strong in the air and 
        have a good touch to control the incoming long ball.
        Usually teams who use this tactics often sit back and let the opposing team
        have the ball and when they lose it they start the attack with a long ball over
        the top for the lone striker.
        Bolton under Sam Allardyce in 2004 often played like this.`,

      title: "PARK THE BUS",
      description: ` Defender who will be able to tuck in, winger that acts as full backs and a sole
        striker upfront is what you'll need when carrying out this tactic.
        This style of play is usually tagged as a negative tactic and is known to be used by
        the famous Jose Mourhino, is said to be like this because everyone in the team is behind
        the ball and not really trying to win the ball back, instead defending very deep and often
        try to counter when the regain posseion.
        This tactic can be used in various occasion like playing out a for a draw when the game is over
        or defending a slender lead like a 1-0 within less than 10 minitues to go.
        Chelsea under Jose Mourhinho in 2013 was a prime example.`,

      title: "HIGH PRESS",
      description: `This tactis requires huge amounts of energy so the forward players
        must be prepared to be running endlessly, midfielders must be prepared
        to win the ball in the opposing half, and defenders have to play a highline
        to choke the midfield and not aloow the opposing team time on the ball.
        This is a very positive style of play because  the team is pressing the opposing
        team for the ball and not giving them time on it which leads to mistakes and they
        can easily capitlizeon that.
        Borussia Dortmund under Jorgen Klopp in 2012 was a prime example`,

        necessary but thier sole purpose remains the same which is to defend.
        This setg pf players are the last line of defence before the goalie so they are very
        important to the team, they must be codinated and focused at all times `,

        team does not go anywhere the goal the deep lying midfielderusually does this role as he/she
        is the deepest of the the midfielders.
        The attacking midfielder gets the ball passed up to the forwards for them to score a goal while
        the wide midfielders make their way to the opposing team's goal and scoring if the opportunity arises.

        where there is one holding and 1 left centre and 1 right centre midefielder and finally 
        a 3 man strike force in this case there is one stiker and 2 wingers.
        This formation is well suited to do the tikitaka tactic because there is enough players in the 
        middle so quick and short passes can be easily implemented.`,

        the is just 2 who play the holding midfield role, but the defence stays the same.
        For the players in attack they are broken into 2, which is a 3 man attack behind a one man striker
        the 3 players behing the lon striker are further broken down into 2 wungers and one attacking midfielder
        who can always drop back and still make a 3 man midfield.
        This formation can also be used for the tikitaka tactic and can also be as more free flowing`,

        the other bank of 4 consists of 2 midfielders and 2 traditional wingers.
        This formation was very suited for the park the bus and longball tactic, because the team could

        but in this case there is a attacking midfielder who just sits behind the line striker up top.
        The attacking midfielder has to be good technically as he is the link between the 4 midfielders
