## `Technologies Used`

    This project uses the React JS framework.React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
    For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MongoDB] package which allows developer to create a custom storage schema and save it to a database.
    For the sign in authentication functionality in the application I used the [JSon Web Token] to implement the authentication functionality.
    I used the google cloud storage config to upload and store my images to the cloud.
        ðŸš¨ Currently, I have not finished working on the project as I am still adding more functionalites to the web application.
